Below are summaries of the different examples and how they are intended to be used.

These examples are to illustrate fitting a simple neural network for 1D and 2D functions.

The 1D and 2D function examples are intended to illustrate how neural networks work in simpler
cases and to provide a proof of concept that the provided code does effectively train
neural networks.

**** tanh ****
Example of training a network to fit a Tanh function.

**** sinc ****
Example of training a network to fit a Sinc function.

**** linreg ****
